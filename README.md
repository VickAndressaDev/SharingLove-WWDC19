# SharingLove-WWDC19
WWDC 2019 Scholarship Playground - Sharing Love [WINNER]

My Playground is a flash-based game called Sharing Love about how to help the angel Anael share love in the shortest possible time, and can be played by users of any age.

For the main features of the game, time is used to control the speed of the hearts. Its visual appearance consists of several icons of several blue hearts that change its color when Anael hits the target using the click and changing its state to a happy heart icon. To make the clouds, the angel, and other scenery components float, I used SpritKit to add small motion effects.

Each click action in the game has an individual sound effect.
